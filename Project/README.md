## Phase 4 : Task 2

Mon Nov 21 11:26:25 PST 2022

Order 0 is created

**Add the drink to the order:**

## Phase 4 : Task 3

I would refactor TakeOrder and TakeOrderGUI. 

After we learned the composite pattern, it makes much more sense
if I have an abstract class that TakeOrder and TakeOrderGUI could both extend.

These two classes are extremely similar, the differences are some little parts of
implementation, but they still have a lot of common that will definitely make things easier 
if they have a superclass. 
Also, if they have the same superType, I wouldn't
need two different reader and writer classes. I could just take the superType as parameter.
